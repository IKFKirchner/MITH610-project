        <p>The history of the <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> at the
        <choice><orig>Univer-<lb break="no"/>sity</orig><reg>University</reg></choice>
        unfolds with awesome slowness. It <lb/>
        evolves over a 20-year period in which <lb/>
        court suits, financial strains and public <lb/>
        opinion gradually open the campus gates <lb/>
        to black Americans.</p>

        <p>The first <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> to attend the University <lb/>
        was <persName><forename>Donald</forename> Gaines <surname>Murray</surname></persName>. A graduate <lb/>
        of <placeName>Amherst</placeName>, <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> applied to the
        <choice>
          <orig>
            Uni-<lb break="no"/>versity

        Law School in <date when= "1935">1935</date>. By <date when="1936">1936</date> he <lb/>
        was accepted. The year's delay in
        <persName><surname><choice><orig>Mur-<lb break="no"/>ray</orig><reg>Murray</reg></choice></surname></persName>
        's acceptance was due to a detour his <lb/>
        application took -- a detour through the <lb/>
        state <orgName>Attorney General's office</orgName> and the <lb/>
        <orgName>Circuit Court of Appeals</orgName>.</p>

        <p>In <date when="1935">1935</date>, <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> was initially refused <lb/>
        admission to the University but offered <lb/>
        a scholarship to <orgName>Howard University</orgName> in <lb/>
        <placeName>Washington, D.C.</placeName>, if he were accepted <lb/>
        there. <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> declined the scholarship <lb/>
        offer, and instead sued the Board of
        <choice><orig>Re-<lb break="no"/>gents</orig><reg>Regents</reg></choice>
        for denying him admission
        <choice><orig>"be-<lb break="no"/>cause</orig><reg>because</reg></choice>
        of his color.</p>

        <p>In court, the University conceded that <lb/>
        <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> was denied admission because of <lb/>
        his race. Education in the state had
        <choice><orig>fol-<lb break="no"/>lowed</orig><reg>followed</reg></choice>
        a separate but equal, bi-racial <lb/>
        policy. Provisions for members of the <lb/>
        <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> race to be sent by scholarship to <lb/>
        professional schools outside the state <lb/>
        were made. The University President <lb/>
        <persName><forename full= "abb"> H. C.</forename> <surname>Byrd</surname></persName> further added that a
        "<choice><orig>finan-<lb break="no"/>cial</orig><reg>financial</reg></choice>
        risk" would be involved in accepting <lb/>
        <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negroes</desc></trait></persName>, for if <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negroes</desc></trait></persName> were admitted <lb/>
        to the state university, it was projected <lb/>
        that many students would withdraw.</p> <cb n= "1"/>


         <p>Defendant <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName>, however, contended <lb/>
         that a law education received at Howard <lb/>
         would not be equal nor comparable to a <lb/>
         law education gained at the University. <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> intended to practice law in
         <placeName><choice><orig>Bal-<lb break="no"/>timore</orig><reg>Baltimore</reg></choice></placeName>
         City, and the University legal <lb/>
         curriculum included special courses in <lb/>
         Maryland law. If he attended <orgName>oward</orgName>H, <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> felt he would be at a

         when competing in a <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> <lb/>
         court with white lawyers schooled in the <lb/>
         state.</p>

         <p>On the grounds that <persName>Murray</persName> had been <lb/>
         denied admission to the University <lb/>
         due only to the color of his skin, a violation <lb/>
         of the Fourteenth Amendment was
         <choice><orig>de-<lb break="no"/>clared</orig><reg>declared</reg></choice>
         by the Court. <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> was
          <choice><orig>ad-<lb break="no"/>mitted</orig><reg>admitted</reg></choice>
         to the University's Law School in <lb/>

         <p><persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName>'s bold and successful court <lb/>
         fight signalled the start of other <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> <lb/>
         advances to the gates of the University. <lb/>
         The law school began receiving--and <lb/>
         accepting--other <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> applications, and <lb/>
         by <date when="1939">1939</date> there were three <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negroes</desc></trait></persName>

         <p>Although the law school now had an <lb/>
         integrated admissions policy, for the next <lb/>
         15 years all other branches of the
         <choice><orig>Uni-<lb break="no"/>versity</orig><reg>University</reg></choice>
         remained segregated. In <date when="1946">1946</date> and <lb/>
         again in <date when="1949">1949</date>, the School of Pharmacy <lb/>
         denied admission to <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> applicants. <lb/>
         Several <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negroes</desc></trait></persName> applying to

         classes in <placeName>College Park</placeName> were <lb/>
         also refused enrollment.<lb/></p>

        <p>The University's admissions policy <lb/>
        was clearly bi-racial: <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> profes- <cb n= "2"/>

         <p><orgName>Morgan</orgName> and <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> were two <lb/>
         state-owned <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> institutions. <orgName>Morgan</orgName> <lb/>
         operates apart from the University. <lb/>
         <orgName>Princess Ann</orgName> was incorporated into the <lb/>
         University in <date when="1935">1935</date> to comply with a
         <choice><orig>sec-<lb break="no"/>tion</orig><reg>section</reg></choice>
         on <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> education in the <orgName>Land Grant <lb/>
         College</orgName>. (The Morrill Act.)</p>

         <p>This statute required that a share of <lb/>
         land-grant allocations go to <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negroes</desc></trait></persName>. <lb/>
         By both annexing and recognizing
         <orgName><choice><orig>Prin-<lb break="no"/>cess</orig><reg>Princess</reg></choice>
         Anne</orgName> as a land-grant college for <lb/>
         colored students, the University could <lb/>
         continue to receive Federal funds granted <lb/>

          for the <orgName>Eastern Shore college</orgName>. <lb/>
         Money was to be distributed

         on the basis of state population, <lb/>
         between the white and <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> branches of <lb/>
         the school. Initially, $210,000 was poured <lb/>
         into <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName>. Over the next decade <lb/>
         however, the <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> institution was more or less ignored.<lb/></p>

         <p>In <date when="1947">1947</date> an investigation of <orgName>Princess <lb/>
         Anne</orgName> was released by the <orgName>Marbury
         <choice><orig>Com-<lb break="no"/>mission</orig><reg>Commision</reg></choice></orgName>.
         In its final report, the Com- <cb n= "3"/>


         mission described the institution as a <lb/>
         "Jim-Crow school." Plumbing was
         <choice><orig>de-<lb break="no"/>ficient</orig><reg>deficient</reg></choice>,
         dormitories inadequate and many <lb/>
         buildings were of "indefinite origin." <lb/>
         Academically, the institution was only a <lb/>
         shadow of a college; it was unaccredited, <lb/>
         its faculty was small, its enrollment had <lb/>
         never surpassed 159 and half of the
         <choice><orig>stu-<lb break="no"/>dent</orig><reg>student</reg></choice>
         body came from out of state.<lb/></p>

         <p>The Commission concluded that
         <orgName><choice><orig>Prin-<lb break="no"/>cess</orig><reg>Princess</reg></choice>
         Anne</orgName> had proved unsuccessful as a <lb/>
         <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> institution. It was recommended <lb/>
         that <orgName>Morgan State College</orgName>, the accredited <lb/>
         <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> school in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, assume
         <choice><orig>con-<lb break="no"/>trol</orig><reg>control</reg></choice>
         of <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName>. <orgName>Morgan State</orgName>, the <lb/>
         Commission felt, had greater resources <lb/>
         and its location would attract more <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> <lb/>
         undergraduates than the <orgName>Somerset County <lb/>
         school</orgName> had.</p>

         <p>This recommendation was received <lb/>
         like a bomb by University President <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>. A two-year fight began between <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>, the <orgName>State Legislature</orgName> and the
         com- munity
         . <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName> wanted to keep <orgName>Princess <lb/>
         Anne</orgName> in his domain. He made sweeping <lb/>
         promises to the <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> populace
          <choice><orig>concern-<lb break="no"/>ing</orig><reg>concerning</reg></choice>
         the potential of <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName>. He <lb/>
         proposed to the legislature a four million <lb/>
         dollar appropriation to rebuild and
          <choice><orig>re-<lb break="no"/>vitalize</orig><reg>revitalize</reg></choice>
         the <orgName full="abb">Eastern Shore</orgName> facilities.<lb/></p>

         <p>At hearings, <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>'s opponents noted <lb/>
         that the University had incorporated <lb/>
         <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> in <date when="1936">1936</date> but had "failed <lb/>
         to perform its duty." A Baltimore Sun <cb n= "4"/></p>
       </div>


         <div><p>editorial called <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> "a <lb/>
         kind of Cinderella to the
         <choice><orig>Univer-<lb break="no"/>sity</orig><reg>University</reg></choice>."
         <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>'s effort to sustain <lb/>
         the institution, stated the Sun, <lb/>
         was an effort to stop "a threat <lb/>
         to part of his domain, not a

         effort for the welfare of the <lb/>
         <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> community. Furthermore, <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>'s move to pour four million <lb/>
         dollars into the college was a <lb/>
         plan to "so deeply commit the <lb/>
         State "to the development of
         <orgName><choice><orig>Prin-<lb break="no"/>cess</orig><reg>Princess</reg></choice> Anne</orgName>,

         <p>Unabashed, <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName> replied by <lb/>
         emphasizing that the State of <lb/>
         <placeName>Maryland</placeName>'s education policy was <lb/>
         one of "controlled segregation." <lb/>
         Following the hectic summer <lb/>
         session, the <orgName>NAACP</orgName> found itself <lb/>
         defending <persName><forename>Martin</forename> B. <surname>Booth</surname></persName>, a <lb/>
         <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> applicant to the <orgName>Maryland <lb/>School of Pharmacy</orgName>.
         <persName><surname>Booth</surname></persName> had <lb/>
         applied to the school in May of <lb/>
         <date when="1948">1948</date> and had been rejected on <lb/>
         the grounds that "the school has <lb/>
         filled its quota." However, on <lb/>
         August 14 of that same year, <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Booth</surname></persName> reapplied for admission <lb/>
         the next, or any succeeding
         <choice><orig>se-<lb break="no"/>mester</orig><reg>semester</reg></choice>

         <p>This time the University

         <persName><surname>Booth</surname></persName> went to court, claiming <lb/>
         that the original "rejection was <lb/>
         based not on the time of his

         but because of his race <lb/>

         <p>In newspaper statements, <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName><lb/>
         responded to <persName><surname>Booth</surname></persName>'s accusation. <lb/>
         "We haven't turned down anybody <lb/>

         <p><persName><surname>Booth</surname></persName>'s case was apparently <lb/>
         lost somewhere on the litigation <lb/>

         <p>The summer of <date when="1949">1949</date> abounded <lb/>

         <p>A total of six suits were brought <lb/>

         by stating that the University had <lb/>
         a "general policy of segregation. <lb/>

         or scholarships to <lb/>
         out-of-state schools.</p>

         <p>Provisions for out-of-state <lb/>
         scholarships were arranged by <lb/>
         the University in conjunction with <lb/>
         the <orgName>Southern Regional Compact</orgName>. <lb/>
         This compact was composed of <lb/>
         14 Southern states which pooled <lb/>
         their educational facilities. When <lb/>
         certain programs were lacking in <lb/>
         one state, resources from another <lb/>
         state could be used.</p>

         <p>Up until <date when="1949">1949</date>, the Regional <lb/>
         Contracts had been, in total, <lb/>
         awarded to 18 <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negroes</desc></trait></persName> and 217 <lb/>
         whites. The Compact was not <lb/>
         viewed as a means for thwarting <lb/>
         integration.</p>

         <p>In <date when="1949">1949</date>, however, local groups <lb/>

         Miss <persName><surname>McCready</surname></persName> claimed <lb/>

         <p>The University, however, felt <lb/>

         of- <lb/>
         fering the applicant a scholarship <lb/>
         to <orgName>MeHarry</orgName>. In court it was even <lb/>
         brought out that <orgName>MeHarry</orgName> was a <lb/>

         <p>A lower court upheld the

         of the University. But the <lb/>
         <orgName>Maryland Circuit Court of
         <choice><orig>Ap-<lb break="no"/>peals</orig><reg>Appeals</reg></choice></orgName>
         reversed this decision. <lb/>

         <p>Referring to State of <placeName>Missouri</placeName><lb/>
         ex-rel. Gaines v. Canada, the <lb/>
         Court held that a scholarship to <lb/>

         state of its responsibility to

         within the boundaries of <lb/>
         the State. By no rational means <lb/>
         could the State extend its

          <p>The Court further held that the <lb/>
          "regional compact cannot be used <lb/>
          to maintain a segregated system <lb/>
          of higher education." Miss <persName><surname>Mc-<lb/>Cready</surname></persName>'s

          </p>

          <p>Still fighting for its segregation <lb/>
          policy, the University appealed <lb/>
          this decision to the <orgName>Supreme <lb/>Court</orgName>.
          The <orgName>High Court</orgName>, however, <lb/>
          denied certiori, and the issue was <lb/>
          settled. Miss <persName><surname>McCready</surname></persName> became <lb/>
          the first <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> to attend the <lb/>
          Nursing School.</p>

          <p>The implications of the case <lb/>
          were clear. The University would <lb/>

          i.e. a "dual school system" over <lb/>

          years, new programs were

<div>

          <p>In <date when="1951">1951</date> <persName><forename>Hiram</forename> T. <surname>Whittle</surname></persName>, a 20 <lb/>
          year old <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> who wished to <lb/>
          transfer from <orgName>Morgan State</orgName> into <lb/>
          the <orgName>College Park engineering</orgName> <lb/>
          program, received a writ of <lb/>
          mandamus admitting him to the <lb/>
          University. The State's attorney <lb/>
          general advised the <orgName>Board of
          <choice><orig>Re-<lb break="no"/>gents</orig><reg>Regents</reg></choice>,</orgName>
          to accept <persName><surname>Whittle</surname></persName> since <lb/>
          <placeName>College Park</placeName> housed the only <lb/>
          state supported engineering
          <choice><orig>fa-<lb break="no"/>cilities</orig><reg>facilities</reg></choice>,
          in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>.</p>

          <p><persName><surname>Whittle</surname></persName> thereby set several <lb/>
          precedents. He was the first <lb/>
          <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> admitted to the University <lb/>
          without a court battle--though he <lb/>
          did follow in the wake of the <persName><surname>Mc- <lb/>Cready</surname></persName>
          storm. He was also the <lb/>
          first <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> to attend classes in <lb/>
          the <placeName>College Park</placeName> campus and to <lb/>
          live in a white dormitory.</p>

          <p>At this same time, another <lb/>
          <persName><trait type= "ethnicity"><desc>Negro</desc></trait></persName> student was pushing his <lb/>
          way through the Courts. <persName><forename>Parren</forename><lb/> J. <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>,
          a graduate student <lb/>

          University in August of <date when="1950">1950</date>. <lb/>
          <persName><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> was accepted with the <lb/>
          tacit understanding that he attend <lb/>

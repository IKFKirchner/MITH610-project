<h4>On Encoding "The Negro on Campus"</h4>

<p>As the first part in a larger series on the history of African-American students at the University of Maryland, "The Negro on Campus" traces the first steps of African-Americans campaigning for their rights to equal opportunity and education by claiming these rights in court. Written in 1967, this article traces the transition phase from a segregated to an integrated University in a double sense: On the one hand, it broaches the issue of justice and access to education from the perspective of African-American students attempting to enroll at the University of Maryland and reveals the systematic institutional discrimination of African-Americans by describing the bureaucratic challenges they encounter. On the other hand, on a discursive level, the language and structure of the article itself tells its own story of segregation and integration in the 1960's. Therefore, encoding this article requires a special focus not only on the data it provides, but also on how it is presented, and which terminology is chosen.
</p>

<p>Accordingly, I chose to encode 1) the structure of the article's layout, 2) historical data on the bureaucratic and legal process by marking the names of people, of institutions, organizations and places, that were involved in the process as well as the dates that are provided, and 3) the use of the word "Negro" in referring to the collective of African-Americans in general or, used as an adjective, in referring to individual persons (marked yellow). Making this distinction on the code level proved to be impossible. In fact, encoding "Negro" at all meant making rather uncomfortable choices: Since "Negro" is not consistently used as an adjective and therefore as an attribute to further describe an already named person, but instead is often used as a generalization referring to African-Americans as a collective, it cannot merely be encoded as a "trait" of the type "ethnicity". However, encoding "Negro" as part of an individual's name is also problematic because it presents their ethnicity as a defining feature of their identity equal to that of a name, as if an African-American individual was not sufficiently described by their name alone as is the case for white individuals. I therefore chose to encode "Negro" as both, a part of a personal name and as a trait thereby drawing attention to the ambiguous function it has in the article.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article concentrates on the bureaucratic facts and omits the perspective of the actual subject. This can be regarded a form of archival silencing in that "the institution" gets a voice, but its subject "the Negro" does not.  By encoding this bureaucratic data, but not individual experiences, this archival silencing is put into effect once more. "Critical fabulation" can fill this silence and tell the non-bureaucratic individual stories of humiliation, struggle and triumph. However, my personal choice is to leave these gaps and silences wide open as an urgent warning to hear those stories today from those who we can choose to give a voice.
</p>

<h2>Language, TEI and racial discrimination</h2>
<h4>On Encoding "Interdating - The Negro point of view"</h4>
</p>

<p>In contrast to the bureaucratic factual tone of the first and the subsequent articles of the series, this last article focuses on individual students' experiences with interracial dating on the now integrated campus of the University of Maryland in 1967. Interestingly, the students report the development of a trend, that has become increasingly visible on today's dating platforms and reveals a striking imbalance in the popularity of different ethnical groups: While white girls are supposedly taking interest in both - white and African-American men -, African-American women are less popular among men of all races and ethnicities. Today, this bias has been confirmed and well researched, showing that stereotypes and prejudices frame African-American men as exotic, overly sexual and adventurous, while African American women are perceived as less intellectual and more "loose". This article is therefore an important witness to the early developmental phase of a discriminatory trend that is more alive than ever in today's society.
</p>

<p>Despite the relevance of this article, encoding its content, however, poses a serious challenge. While quantifiable and factual data like personal, institutional and organizational names, locations and dates can easily be categorized and grouped together for comparison, individual experiences, feelings and impressions are difficult to categorize and, consequently, to encode.
</p>

<p>Although I chose to encode the same categories of words as in the previous article, namely 1) the structure of the article's layout, 2) historical data marking the names of people, of institutions, organizations and places and dates, and 3) the use of the word "Negro" (marked yellow); significantly less information was encoded, simply because the article provides less such information. This is hardly a surprise: Sharing individual experiences does not depend on precise information regarding who, when and where, but naturally has a different, non-quantifiable focus on individual feelings and thoughts. Moreover, the names of the students who are quoted in the article were omitted, probably in order to protect their privacy. However, the result is problematic from the perspective of an archivist: Encoding is an important scientific tool for making data accessible and analyzable. Encoded information is therefore more likely to be the subject of scientific research simply because it is available. That can create another archival silence, and again, mutes the individual and his or her experience and point of view.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, the articles use of the word "negro" is interesting, especially in comparison to the first article. Here, it is used as an adjective parallel to "pretty" or "young" for example and used to provide some detail to the otherwise anonymous individual. As a result, the article frequently uses "white" in order to clarify whether or not the quoted individual is African American. While "whiteness" is simply the norm in the first article and therefore doesn't need to be specifically mentioned but can simply be assumed whenever there are no further specifications, in this article "whiteness" needs to be explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I have encoded "negro" and "white" both as "traits" of the type "ethnicity", in order to make the frequency and context of their use comparable.
</p>

<p>Since this article does provide first-person accounts on individual experiences, critical fabulation is not necessary in order to fill this gap. Rather, quantifiable data is missing in order to complement these accounts. Fortunately, today's data from dating platforms confirm these individual experiences that were long enough brushed aside as "female jealousy" or "a matter of perspective" and fill the "factual gap" in the archive.
